  <h2>Life</h2>
  <p>Etel Adnan was born in 1925 in Beirut, Lebanon. Adnan's mother was
    Greek Orthodox from Smyrna and her father was a Muslim-Turkish high-ranking
    Ottoman officer born in Damascus, Ottoman Syria. Her father came from a
    wealthy family; he was a top officer and former classmate of Mustafa Kemal
    Atat√ºrk at the military academy. Prior to marrying Adnan's mother, her
    father was already married with three children. In contrast, Adnan's
    mother was raised in extreme poverty; her parents met in Smyrna during World
    War I while her father was serving as Governor of Smyrna. After the Ottoman
    Empire collapsed and Smyrna was burned during the Occupation of Smyrna,
    Adnan's parents migrated to Beirut. Though she grew up speaking Greek
    and Turkish in a primarily Arabic-speaking society, she was educated at
    French convent schools and French became the language in which her early
    work was first written. She also studied English in her youth, and
    most of her later work has been first written in this language.</p>

  <p>At 24, Adnan traveled to Paris where she received a degree in philosophy
    from the University of Paris. She then traveled to the United States
    where she continued graduate studies at the University of California,
    Berkeley and at Harvard University. From 1952 to 1978, she taught
    philosophy of art at the Dominican University of California in San Rafael.
    She has also lectured at many universities throughout the United States.

  <p>Adnan returned from the US to Lebanon and worked as a journalist and
    cultural editor for Al-Safa Newspaper, a French-language newspaper in
    Beirut. In addition, she also helped build the cultural section of the
    newspaper, occasionally contributing cartoons and illustrations.
    Her tenure at Al-Safa was most notable for her front-page editorials,
    commenting on the important political issues of the day.</p>

  <p>In her later years, Adnan began to openly identify as lesbian.</p>
