  <h2>Visual Art</h2>
  <p>Adnan also works as a painter, her earliest abstract works were created
    using a palette knife to apply oil paint onto the canvas – often directly
    from the tube – in firm swipes across the picture's surface. The focus of
    the compositions often being a red square, she remains interested in the
    "immediate beauty of colour". In 2012, a series of the artist's
    brightly colored abstract paintings were exhibited as a part of documenta
    13 in Kassel, Germany.</p>

  <p>In the 1960s, she began integrating Arabic calligraphy into her artworks
    and her books, such as Livres d’Artistes [Artist's Books].
    She recalls sitting for hours copying words from an Arabic grammar without
    trying to understand the meaning of the words. Her art is very much
    influenced by early hurufiyya artists including; Iraqi artist, Jawad Salim,
    Palestinian writer and artist, Jabra Ibrahim Jabra and Iraqi painter Shakir
    Hassan al Said, who rejected Western aesthetics and embraced a new art form
    which was both modern and yet referenced traditional culture, media and
    techniques.</p>

  <p>Inspired by Japanese leporellos, Adnan also paints landscapes on to
    foldable screens that can be "extended in space like free-standing drawings"
    .</p>

  <p>In 2014, a collection of the artist's paintings and tapestries were exhibited as a part of the
    Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>
  <p>Adnan's retrospective at Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art in Doha, titled "Etel Adnan In All
    Her Dimensions" and curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, featured eleven dimensions of Adnan's
    practice. It included her early works, her literature, her carpets, and other. The show was
    launched in March 2014, accompanied by a 580-page catalog of her work published jointly by
    Mathaf and Skira. The catalog was designed by artist Ala Younis in Arabic and English, and
    included text contributions by Simone Fattal, Daniel Birnbaum, Kaelen Wilson-Goldie, as well as
    six interviews with Hans-Ulrich Obrist.</p>
  <p>In 2017, Adnan's work was included in "Making Space: Women Artists and Postwar Abstraction," a
    group exhibition organized by MoMA, which brought together prominent artists including Ruth
    Asawa, Gertrudes Altschul, Anni Albers, Magdalena Abakanowicz, Lygia Clark, and Lygia Pape,
    among others.

  </p>
  <p>In 2018, MASS MoCA hosted a retrospective of the artist, titled "A yellow sun A green sun a
    yellow sun A red sun a blue sun", including a selection of paintings in oil and ink, as well as
    a reading room of her written works. The exhibition explored how the experience of reading
    poetry differs from the experience of looking at a painting.

  </p>
  <p>Published in 2018, "Etel Adnan", a biography of the artist written by Kaelen Wilson-Goldie,
    inquires into the artist's work as a shaman and activist. In 2020, the Griffin Poetry
    Prize is awarded to her book Time.
